## Deployment

### Environment Setup
This project uses separate environment files for local development and production to keep sensitive information secure and make deployments smoother.

1️⃣ Create Your Environment Files
From the project root:

bash
cp .env.example .env.local
.env.local — for local development (never committed)

.env.production — for production deployment (never committed)

⚠️ Never commit .env.local or .env.production

2️⃣ Fill in Environment Variables
Open .env.local and add your real values:

env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-local-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/bookworm_db
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8000
For .env.production:

env
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<database>?sslmode=require
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,.herokuapp.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://yourapp.herokuapp.com
3️⃣ Choosing the Environment
Run with the desired environment:

Local development:

bash
export ENVIRONMENT=local
python manage.py runserver
Production:

bash
export ENVIRONMENT=production
# start your production server (e.g., gunicorn, Heroku will handle this)
4️⃣ .env.example for Onboarding
.env.example is committed to the repo and contains placeholders only. Anyone setting up the project can copy it to .env.local and fill in their own values.

env
DEBUG=
SECRET_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
ALLOWED_HOSTS=
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=



### Host & CSRF Configuration

This project uses environment‑based settings for domain and CSRF protection, making it easy to switch between development, staging, and production without touching code.

ALLOWED_HOSTS — List of hostnames the app will serve. Loaded from environment variables, with sensible fallbacks for local dev (localhost, 127.0.0.1).

CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS — Fully‑qualified, HTTPS‑prefixed domains allowed for secure form submissions and admin access.

Example: Local .env

ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://bookworm-library.herokuapp.com

Example: Heroku Config Vars

heroku config:set ALLOWED_HOSTS=bookworm-library-162a2f259259.herokuapp.com,localhost,127.0.0.1
heroku config:set CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://bookworm-library-162a2f259259.herokuapp.com
